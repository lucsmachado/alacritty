# Alacritty
My personal setup for the [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) terminal emulator. All configuration files are in TOML format.

## Font
I use a font called **JetBrainsMono**, which is especifically made for programmers and provides a more readable rendering of relational operators (equal to, greater than, etc.) and other commonly used operators, such as arrows. 

It, as well as other programming-friendly fonts, can be downloaded from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).

## Theme
For the colorscheme, I chose [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/alacritty).
